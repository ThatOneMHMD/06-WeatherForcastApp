## Features

- When the user searches for a city by inputing the city name into the input box, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- when the user views the current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name (and matching country code), the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- When the user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
- When the user inputs an invalid city name, a red text appear under the search box reading "Invalid city name, please try again!" and this input is not saved into the search history
- When the user selects between imperial and metric, the units of measurements are converted to match chosen units (for example, from MPH to KPH and vice versa)
- When the user inputs city and the country code turns out to be different from their expectations, they are able to actively search for the desired city by following the city name with a comma and a two-letter Country Code (for example: Ottawa, CA)
- When the number of city names in the search history exceeds 10, only the most recent 10 will remain while the last searched will be deleted
- When the user inputs a new city name, it will appear at the top of the search history. Additionally, this will also occur if the user searches for a city that is already included in the search history or simply clicks on it; no replicas of the city names will exist
